#' Characteristics of various internal combustion engines
#'
#' Internal combustion engines have been built for a variety of purposes
#' ranging from propelling small model airplanes to powering trucks to driving
#' the propellers of giant ships.  This data frame gives the characteristics
#' of a wide size range of such engines.

#'   A data frame with 39 cases, each of which is an internal combustion engine, with observations on the following variables.
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item{\code{mass}} {In pounds}
#'     \item{\code{ncylinder}} {Number of cylinders}
#'     \item{\code{stroke}} {The length  of the stroke made by a piston}
#'     \item{\code{strokes}} {Whether the engine cycle is 2-stroke or 4-stroke.}
#'     \item{\code{displacement}} {In cc}
#'     \item{\code{bore}} {Diameter of the piston}
#'     \item{\code{BHP}} {The power generated by  the engine. One BHP is the same as 745.7 Watts.}
#'     \item{\code{RPM}} {The speed, in revolutions per second, at which the engine generates the listed BHP.}
#'   }
