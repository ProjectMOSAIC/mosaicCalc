    one of many data- and modeling-oriented educational resources developed by 
    Project MOSAIC (<http://www.mosaic-web.org/>). Provides symbolic and
    numerical differentiation and integration, as well as support for 
    applied linear algebra (for data science), and differential equations/dynamics.
    Includes `{ggformula}`-based graphics for graphing functions, vector fields, trajectories, etc.
    The software is suitable for general use, but mainly intended for teaching calculus.
