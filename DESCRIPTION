Title: Function-Based Numerical and Symbolic Differentiation and Antidifferentiation
Description:  Part of the Project MOSAIC (<http://mosaic-web.org/>)
    suite that provides utility functions for doing calculus 
    (differentiation and integration) in R. The main differentiation and 
    antidifferentiation operators are described using formulas and return functions 
    rather than numerical values. Numerical values can be obtained by evaluating
    these functions.
