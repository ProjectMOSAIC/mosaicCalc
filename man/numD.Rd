\usage{
numD(tilde, ..., .h = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tilde}{a mathematical expression (see examples and \code{\link{plotFun}})}

\item{\dots}{additional parameters, typically default values for mathematical parameters}

\item{.h}{numerical step size to enforce.}
}
\value{
a function implementing the derivative as a finite-difference approximation.
This has a second argument, \code{.h}, that allow the finite-difference to be set when evaluating
the function. The default values are set for reasonable numerical precision
with the pattern-book functions.
}
\description{
Constructs the numerical derivatives of mathematical expressions
}
\details{
Uses a simple finite-difference scheme to evaluate the derivative.  The function created
will not contain a formula for the derivative.  Instead, the original function is stored
at the time the derivative is constructed and that original function is re-evaluated at the
finitely-spaced points of an interval.  If you redefine the original function, that won't affect
any derivatives that were already defined from it.
Numerical derivatives, particularly high-order ones, are unstable.  The finite-difference parameter
\code{.h} is set, by default, to give reasonable results for first- and second-order derivatives.
It's tweaked a bit so that taking a second derivative by differentiating a first derivative
will give reasonably accurate results.  But,
if taking a second derivative, much better to do it in one step to preserve numerical accuracy.

\note{
WARNING: In the expressions, do not use variable names beginning with a dot, particularly \code{.f} or \code{.h}
