\title{Characteristics of various internal combustion engines}
\format{
A data frame with 39 cases, each of which is an internal combustion engine, with observations on the following variables.
\itemize{
\item{\code{mass}} {In pounds}
\item{\code{ncylinder}} {Number of cylinders}
\item{\code{stroke}} {The length  of the stroke made by a piston}
\item{\code{strokes}} {Whether the engine cycle is 2-stroke or 4-stroke.}
\item{\code{displacement}} {In cc}
\item{\code{bore}} {Diameter of the piston}
\item{\code{BHP}} {The power generated by  the engine. One BHP is the same as 745.7 Watts.}
\item{\code{RPM}} {The speed, in revolutions per second, at which the engine generates the listed BHP.}

\description{
Internal combustion engines have been built for a variety of purposes
ranging from propelling small model airplanes to powering trucks to driving
the propellers of giant ships.  This data frame gives the characteristics
of a wide size range of such engines.
