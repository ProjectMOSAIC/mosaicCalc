\description{
An estimate of the real GDP of the United Kingdom over about 7 centuries. "Real"
means adjusted for inflation. Take such estimates with a large amount of salt, since
pre-industrial era data is very limited and because the components of GDP change substantially
over a few decades, let alone a few centuries. Also, the name \code{UK_GDP} is anachronistic,
since for most of the record is before the UK was created as a political entity.
