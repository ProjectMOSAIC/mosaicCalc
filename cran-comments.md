## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* The note is for a "new submission." But really this is an update. CRAN notified me of a failed check in late December, 2023, but I wasn't able to make the fix before the deadline. The earlier CRAN version was archived on 2024-01-24.

* The previous version of mosaicCalc (0.6.0) failed a test check on some architectures due to an update in another package, Ryacas. With version 0.6.1, the test check passes and some small documentation problems have been fixed. 

## Downstream dependencies

fastR2, MMAC, and RISCA are the reverse dependencies on CRAN. They have been checked.
